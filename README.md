## Documentation
Most documentation can be found in [docs](./docs).<br />
The source code it self is very well documented.

---

## Milestones
See [MILESTONES.md](./MILESTONES.md) to see what we want to achive/plans in upcoming verions

---

## Note
OpenHaus is in a very early development state.<br />
A good start is that you fireup [postman](https://www.postman.com/) import the collection (`postman.json`) and start to get familiar with the HTTP API. For better understanding, see the [üìÅ `components`](./components) folder and browser through the `index.js` files. Here is the schema defined how a "device", "room" or "user" object looks like.

I hope i found soon a solution to document things better...
